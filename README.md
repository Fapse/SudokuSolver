# SudokuSolver
A small sudoku solver with backtracking algorithm in Python.
The program will find one ore more solutions to a given sudoku. If there are no solutions, a message is presented.
This is a simple python project to explore backtracking algorithms. The ideas come from this Youtube-Video: https://youtu.be/9I73elFoze8?si=6Cx_wi31vS94pGJJ by "Programmieren mit Pascal" (in German). I adapted his example in Pascal to Python.
